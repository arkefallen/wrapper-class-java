# wrapper-class-java
This is my documentation of learning about Wrapper Class topics in Java.

My learning source based on PDF documents that I found in the internet.

"Percobaan" directory means "Try It Yourself". This directory contains a practice doing some programs to understand wrapper classes concepts

"Latihan" directory means an exercies. In the document, we are given some exercise to solve it based from our practice before.

"Tugas" directory means Task. One of the task is to solve a problem converting wrapper classes into primitive types and vice versa.
